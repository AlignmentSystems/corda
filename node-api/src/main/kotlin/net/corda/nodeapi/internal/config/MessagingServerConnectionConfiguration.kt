/**
 * Predefined connection configurations used by Artemis clients (currently used in the P2P messaging layer).
 * The enum names represent the approximate total duration of the failover (with exponential back-off). The formula used to calculate
 * this duration is as follows:
 *
 * totalFailoverDuration = SUM(k=0 to [reconnectAttempts]) of [retryInterval] * POW([retryIntervalMultiplier], k)
 *
 * Example calculation for [DEFAULT]:
 *
 * totalFailoverDuration = 5 + 5 * 1.5 + 5 * (1.5)^2 + 5 * (1.5)^3 + 5 * (1.5)^4 = ~66 seconds
 *
 * @param failoverOnInitialAttempt Determines whether failover is triggered if initial connection fails.
 * @param initialConnectAttempts The number of reconnect attempts if failover is enabled for initial connection. A value
 * of -1 represents infinite attempts.
 * @param reconnectAttempts The number of reconnect attempts for failover after initial connection is done. A value
 * of -1 represents infinite attempts.
 * @param retryInterval Duration between reconnect attempts.
 * @param retryIntervalMultiplier Value used in the reconnection back-off process.
 * @param maxRetryInterval Determines the maximum duration between reconnection attempts. Useful when using infinite retries.
