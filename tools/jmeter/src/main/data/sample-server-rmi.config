# This file provides a listing of the ports for the RMI call back tunnel.
# It needs to list all hosts that remote JMeter servers will be running on,
# and provide a separate port for each server. This is just an example to document
# the structure of this file, you will need to create one matching your cluster
# layout and using your own host names.


# The mapping is unqualified hostname to port, the first line would for example
# be for a server at test-node-1.mydomain.com
# Please note that the name listed here must match the unqualified bit of the name
# provided as ssh host on the command line with the --ssh flag, as well as the name
# returned by the hostname command on the server.

# mapping for the test cluster
test-node-1:10101
test-node-2:10102


# If you run several clusters that you connect to with different command lines,
# this file can contain the mapping for all clusters, given they have different
# host names. Port numbers can be reused in a different cluster, but
# not within one cluster. The following would be valid in this file

# mapping for the UAT cluster
uat-node-1:10101
uat-node-2:10102
