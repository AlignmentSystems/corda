HSM Signing Service
===================

The HSM Signing Service is designed to act as a bridge between the networking service and the HSM infrastructure.
Due to possible security concerns, the signing service is meant to be hosted on private premises and not in a cloud environment.
That does not apply to the networking service, which may be hosted by a cloud provider. Such a design allows for, and in fact
was driven by the requirement of, permitting only outgoing connections between the two deployments (i.e. private and cloud).

Having this deployment design in mind, the signing service initiates connection to the networking service database and
retrieves all the data that has to be signed.
This retrieval happens automatically (based on the pre-configured time interval) in case of Network Map and Certificate Revocation List signing.
The on-demand approach applies only in case of Certificate Signing Requests signatures as they involve human interaction (for authentication credentials input).
For that purpose, the service provides a commandline-based interface and guides the user throughout the signing process.

The signing service assumes an HSM configuration in place - i.e. all users and certificates should be set-up on the HSM box,
prior to the signing service deployment and usage. Nevertheless, currently, the signing service comes with a simple utility
that allows an authenticated HSM user to generate the root and intermediate certificates. The utility is only a temporary
solution and should NOT be used in case of production deployment. This convenience feature will be removed in a future release.

Following, are the steps for the signing service operation with respect to every kind of object it signs:

Certificate Signing Request Steps
---------------------------------

* The networking service receives a certificate signing request and approves it (more specifically the certificate signing request is approved using an external ticket tracking tool - e.g. Jira).
It is ready to be signed.

* A privileged user chooses (using the commandline interface) that she wants to sign the approved requests.

* A connection to the networking service database is established and all approved requests are fetched and listed to the user.

* After selecting an appropriate option (either signing all approved requests or just some of them) user is prompted for her username (in terms of the HSM setup).

* Next step is to confirm user's identity against the HSM. In this case, the signing service supports two authentication methods: Password or Card Reader.

* If the user's identity is confirmed (using one of the above methods) and her privileges are strong enough, then the signing process commences using the configured intermediate certificate.

* After that, the networking service database is updated with the signed certificates.

* In case of insufficient user privileges, the service will prompt for another user to be authenticated.

Certificate Revocation List Steps
---------------------------------

* The networking service receives a certificate revocation request and approves it (more specifically the certificate signing request is approved using an external ticket tracking tool - e.g. Jira).
It is ready to be included into the certificate revocation list.

* Periodically (the time interval is pre-configured at the deployment time), the signing service fetches all approved certificate revocation requests. If the list is empty, then nothing happens and means that the current Certificate Revocation List remains unchanged.

* If there is at least one approved certificate revocation request, it means that a new certificate revocation list needs to be created and signed.

* In such a case, the service fetches all (already) revoked certificate revocation requests

* It builds a new certificate revocation list that combines already revoked requests and approved ones.

* The list is signed on HSM with an intermediate certificate whose name (together with the auto-user credentials) was pre-configured at the signing service deployment time

* The signed list is serialised and stored in the networking service database ready to be served. Also, all approved requests become revoked now.


Signing Network Map and Network Parameters
------------------------------------------

* The networking service receives a new (or updated) node info.

* Periodically (the time interval is pre-configured at the deployment time), the signing service fetches from the database all information needed to construct new network map, which includes:
    - current network map,
    - all node info objects with valid certificates,
    - current network parameters
    - information on parameters update (if exists).

* A new network map object is created out of the fetched data.

* If the new network map hash does not differ from the current network map hash, then nothing happens and current network map remains unchanged.

* If they are different, then the newly created network map object is serialized using the Corda AMQP serialisation format and signed by the dedicated intermediate certificate stored in HSM.
The same process applies to network parameters which need to be signed separately.

* Once signed, the new network map data is stored in the networking service database and available for nodes to retrieve when they next poll for the network map.
