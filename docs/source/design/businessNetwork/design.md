HIGH LEVEL DESIGN
---

## Overview

Business Networks are introduced in order to segregate Corda Nodes that do not need to transact with each other or indeed
even know of each other existence. 

The key concept of Business Network is **Business Network Operator ('BNO') node** as a mean for BNOs to serve reference data to members 
of their business network(s), as required by CorDapp(s) specific to that business network. This includes allowing BNO 
nodes to supplement the `NodeInfo`-vending capabilities of the global network map, serving network map entries which are
not listed in the global network map. This allows BNOs to ensure strict privacy of their members and control which IP addresses are used in relation to which CorDapps.

## Background

Multiple prospective clients of Corda Connect expressed concerns about privacy of the nodes and CorDapps they are going to run.
Ability to discover every node in Compatibility Zone through a global network map was not seen as a good design as it 
will allow competing firms to have an insight into on-boarding of the new clients, businesses and flows.

In order to address those privacy concerns Business Networks were introduced as a way to partition nodes into groups 
based on a need-to-know principle. 

This design document reflects on what was previously discussed on this Confluence page
[Business Network Membership](https://r3-cev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCD/pages/131972363/Business+Network+Membership)

## Scope

### Goals

* Allow Corda Connect participants to create private business networks and allow the owner of the network decide which
parties will be included into it;

* Not to allow parties outside of the Business Network to discover the content of the Business Network;

* Provide a reference implementation for a BNO node which enables the node operator to perform actions stated above. 

### Non-goals

* To mandate Business Networks. Business Networks are offered as on optional extra which some of the CorDapps may chose to use;

* To constrain all BNOs to adopt a single consistent CorDapp, for which the design (flows, persistence etc.) is controlled by R3;

* To define inclusion/exclusion or authorisation criteria for admitting a node into a Business Network.  

## Timeline

This is a long-term solution initially aimed to support Project Agent go-live implementation in Q2 2018. 

## Requirements

See [Identity high-level requirements](https://r3-cev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCD/pages/131746442/Identity+high-level+requirements)
for the full set of requirements discussed to date.

Given the following roles:

| Role name                   | Definition |
| --------------------------- | ---------- |
| Compatibility Zone Operator | Responsible for administering the overall Compatibility Zone. Usually R3. |
| Business Network Operator   | Responsible for a specific business network within the Corda Connect Compatibility Zone. |
| Node User                   | Uses a Corda node to carry out transactions on their own behalf. In the case of a self-owned deployment, the Node User can also be the Node Operator. |
| Node Operator               | Responsible for management of a particular corda node (deployment, configuration etc.) on behalf of the Node User. |

The following requirements are addressed as follows:

| Role                        | Requirement                                                                                        | How design satisfies requirement |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Compatibility Zone Operator | To support multiple business networks operating across the CZ.                                     | Current design supports any number of membership lists, each of which defines a business network. |
| Compatibility Zone Operator | To permission a Business Network Operator to provision my services to its members.                 | Individual CordApps will be responsible for checking Business Network membership constrains. |
| Compatibility Zone Operator | To revoke the ability for a specific Business Network Operator to operate within my CZ.            | The membership lists are configurable and business networks can have their membership lists removed when needed. |
| Business Network Operator   | To be able to permission nodes to access my Business Network.                                      | The BNO will ensure that the CorDapp is designed to keep each node's copy of the membership list up-to-date on a timely basis as new members are added to the business network. |
| Business Network Operator   | To revoke access to my business network by any member.                                             | The BNO will ensure that the CorDapp is designed to keep each node's copy of the membership list up-to-date on a timely basis as members are removed from the business network. The BNO will be able to decide, through the timing of the membership list checks in the CorDapp flow design, whether in-flight flows should be exited upon revocation, or simply to avoid starting new flows. |
| Business Network Operator   | To protect knowledge of the membership of my Business Network from parties who don't need to know. | The BNO node upon receiving an enquiry to deliver membership list will first check identity of the caller against membership list. If the identity does not belong to the membership list the content of the membership will not be served. Optionally, Business Network membership list may be made available for discovery by the nodes outside of membership list. |
| Business Network Operator   | To help members of my Business Network to discover each other.                                     | The BNO node will be able to serve the full list of membership participants at a minimum and may also have an API to perform the fuzzy matches. |
| Node User                   | To request the termination of my identity within the CZ / business network.                        | A member may ask a BNO to exclude them from a business network, and it will be in the BNO's commercial interest to do so. They can be obliged to do so reliably under the terms of the R3Net agreement. |
| Node Operator               | To control the IP address on which my node receives messages in relation to a specific CorDapp.    | Nodes may choose to publish different `NodeInfos` to different business networks. Business network-specific CorDapps will ensure that that the `NodeInfo` served by the business network is used for addressing that node. |

## Design Decisions

* Per [New Network Map](https://r3-cev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AWG/pages/127710793/New+Network+Map):
   * R3 will serve a file containing NetworkParameters to all members of the Corda Connect Compatibility Zone, made publicly available via CDN. 
     *NetworkParameters are only served by the network map and cannot be overwritten by BNOs*.
   * The network map file will continue to serve references to downloadable entries 
   (Signed `NodeInfo` file with the node's certificate chain, IP addresses etc. for a given node) for any nodes which wish to be publicly discoverable by all CZ members.

* Nodes **may individually choose** to publish to the global network map by posting their entry to an R3-provided endpoint, 
but are **not required to do so**.

* BNO nodes expose a range of services to their membership over normal Corda flows (via a custom BNO CorDapp deployed on their BNO node).
The BNO is free to define whatever services apply in the context of their business network; these will typically include:     
   * Managing requests to join/leave the business network;
   * Accepting uploads of network map entries (signed `NodeInfos`) from business network members.
   *A node may choose to publish different `NodeInfos` to different business networks in order to indicate that they want 
   to be addressed on a given IP in relation to a given set of traffic.*
   * Vending a membership list of distinguished names (DNs) that a given party within the business network is allowed 
   to see / transact with, for use in 'address book' / 'drop-down' type UI functionality. 
   *The structure of the membership list may be tailored according to the needs of the BNO and, according to the needs 
   of the CorDapp, it may either be expressed as a subclass of the `NetworkMapCache` itself or as a standalone data structure in its own right.*
   * Vending `NodeInfos` in response to lookup requests by a business network member for a particular DN 
   (more sophisticated query options may also be offered), which are integrated into the node's local `NetworkMapCache`.
   *A node may acquire multiple `NodeInfos` in relation to the same DN via its association with multiple business networks
   and needs a mechanism to (a) retain distinctions between them, (b) when initiating a flow by a specific CorDapp, 
   preferentially address messages to the IP(s) referenced in the `NodeInfo` served by the associated business network.* 

* For each **Business Network-specific CorDapp**, the CorDapp developer will include features to restrict such that the
CorDapp cannot be used to transact with non-members. Namely:
   * any 'address-book' features in that CorDapp are filtered according to the membership list;
   * any `InitiatedBy` flow will first check that the initiating party is on the membership list, and throw a `FlowException` if it is not.

## Target Solution

*Illustration of services exposed by both network map and BNO node. Interface names shown are indicative and may be changed as needed.*

![Business Network diagram](businessNetwork.png)

## Complementary solutions

* No requirement to change the Network Map design currently proposed in
[New Network Map](https://r3-cev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AWG/pages/127710793/New+Network+Map);
* Data model for `NetworkMapCache` needs to be able to manage potential conflicts between `NodeInfos` downloaded from different
network maps, and supply the correct one when needed. 

## Final recommendation

* Proceed with reference implementation as detailed by [this Jira](https://r3-cev.atlassian.net/browse/R3NET-546).
* Provision of mechanisms to bind accessibility of CorDapp flows to named parties on a membership list.
