<p>A sub-class of <a href="index.html">ProtocolLogic</a> implements a protocol flow using direct, straight line blocking code. Thus you
can write complex protocol logic in an ordinary fashion, without having to think about callbacks, restarting after
a node crash, how many instances of your protocol there are running and so on.</p>
<p>Invoking the network will cause the call stack to be suspended onto the heap and then serialized to a database using
the Quasar fibers framework. Because of this, if you need access to data that might change over time, you should
request it just-in-time via the <a href="service-hub.html">serviceHub</a> property which is provided. Dont try and keep data you got from a
service across calls to send/receive/sendAndReceive because the world might change in arbitrary ways out from
underneath you, for instance, if the node is restarted or reconfigured</p>
<p>Additionally, be aware of what data you pin either via the stack or in your <a href="index.html">ProtocolLogic</a> implementation. Very large
objects or datasets will hurt performance by increasing the amount of data stored in each checkpoint.</p>
<p>If youd like to use another ProtocolLogic class as a component of your own, construct it on the fly and then pass
it to the <a href="sub-protocol.html">subProtocol</a> method. It will return the result of that protocol when it completes.</p>
