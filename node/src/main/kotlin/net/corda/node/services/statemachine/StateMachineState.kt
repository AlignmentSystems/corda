/**
 * The state of the state machine, capturing the state of a flow. It consists of two parts, an *immutable* part that is
 * persisted to the database ([Checkpoint]), and the rest, which is an in-memory-only state.
 *
 * @param checkpoint the persisted part of the state.
 * @param flowLogic the [FlowLogic] associated with the flow. Note that this is mutable by the user.
 * @param pendingDeduplicationHandlers the list of incomplete deduplication handlers.
 * @param closedSessionsPendingToBeSignalled the sessions that have been closed and need to be signalled to the messaging layer on the next checkpoint (along with some metadata).
 * @param isFlowResumed true if the control is returned (or being returned) to "user-space" flow code. This is used
 *   to make [Event.DoRemainingWork] idempotent.
 * @param isWaitingForFuture true if the flow is waiting for the completion of a future triggered by one of the statemachine's actions
 * @param future If the flow is relying on a [Future] completing, then this field will be set otherwise it remains null
 * @param isAnyCheckpointPersisted true if at least a single checkpoint has been persisted. This is used to determine
 *   whether we should DELETE the checkpoint at the end of the flow.
 * @param isStartIdempotent true if the start of the flow is idempotent, making the skipping of the initial checkpoint
 *   possible.
 * @param isRemoved true if the flow has been removed from the state machine manager. This is used to avoid any further
 *   work.
 * @param isKilled true if the flow has been marked as killed. This is used to cause a flow to move to a killed flow transition no matter
 * what event it is set to process next.
 * @param senderUUID the identifier of the sending state machine or null if this flow is resumed from a checkpoint so that it does not participate in de-duplication high-water-marking.
 * @param reloadCheckpointAfterSuspendCount The number of times a flow has been reloaded (not retried). This is [null] when
 * [NodeConfiguration.reloadCheckpointAfterSuspendCount] is not enabled.
 * @param numberOfCommits The number of times the flow's checkpoint has been successfully committed. This field is a var so that it can be
 * updated after committing a database transaction that contained a checkpoint insert/update.
 * @param lock The flow's lock, used to prevent the flow performing a transition while being interacted with from external threads, and
 * vise-versa.
