This is a legal agreement between you and us, so please read it carefully. By clicking the "I Agree" button below, you agree to these terms.



1.	License; Authorized Users; Unauthorized Access.

	1.1	License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, R3 hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts, a royalty-free, revocable, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as permitted in the remainder of this Section 1.1) license to use the Corda Enterprise Software (in object code form only) and R3's current standard documentation associated therewith (the "Documentation"), solely for purposes of (a) internal testing and evaluation of the Corda Enterprise Software and of demonstrating the functions and features of the Corda Enterprise Software ("Demonstration Purposes"), and (b) developing and testing applications ("CorDapps") that interface with any application programming interface ("API") included in the Corda Enterprise Software ("Development Purposes"), and not for any other purpose.  For the sake of clarity, Licensee agrees that it shall not use the Corda Enterprise Software for commercial, production (other than with respect to duplicative live data used solely for evaluation purposes in a non-production environment) or revenue-generating activities (other than in connection with the development and support of CorDapps).  Except for the foregoing license, nothing herein shall be construed to transfer to Licensee any rights, title or interest in or to the Corda Enterprise Software, including without limitation, intellectual property rights therein.  Licensee may sublicense the license rights granted herein to any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control, in each case either directly or indirectly with Licensee, where "control" means the ownership of, or the power to vote, more than 50% of the voting stock, shares or interests of the relevant entity (collectively, "Affiliates"); provided that Licensee shall be responsible any breach or default by any Affiliate of Licensee of any terms or conditions of this Agreement applicable to Licensee.

	1.2	Access.  Licensee shall not make the Corda Enterprise Software available to anyone other than Licensee's employees, consultants and independent contractors and shall take all steps necessary to ensure that no person or entity shall have unauthorized access to the Corda Enterprise Software, including implementing industry standard technical measures to restrict access that are in no event less than the measures employed to protect Licensee's and its Affiliates' own proprietary technology.

1.3	Updates and Modifications.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that R3 may make available to Licensee modifications or updates to the Corda Enterprise Software or the Documentation from time to time, including by posting a link or otherwise providing access allowing Licensee to download such modifications or updates.   Licensee agrees to implement such modifications and updates within any required time period specified by R3 in connection with the notice of such modification or update, or if no time period is specified, within 30 days; provided that Licensee may continue to use prior versions of the Corda Enterprise Software solely for purposes of testing and certifying against newer versions.  Licensee expressly acknowledges that such modifications may change the functionality of the Corda Enterprise Software and integration with other systems (including Licensee's CorDapps), and may not be backward compatible with earlier versions of Corda Enterprise Software. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that in the event updates to Licensee's CorDapps are needed to ensure compatibility with modifications or updates to the Corda Enterprise Software, Licensee shall be responsible for making such changes.

2.	CorDapps

2.1	Development of CorDapps; Ownership Rights.  Licensee agrees that it will not include any portion of the Corda Enterprise Software or any other proprietary code of R3 in any CorDapp or other software of Licensee.  R3 agrees that it will obtain no right, title or interest from Licensee under this Agreement in or to any CorDapp developed by or on behalf of Licensee, including any intellectual property rights therein.

For the sake of clarity, Licensee shall not distribute any software or device incorporating any part of the Corda Enterprise Software or the Documentation, and shall not allow its customers to access the Corda Enterprise Software through Licensee, including through a service bureau, third party hosting or application provider arrangement. Licensee shall specify to all customers that Licensee's CorDapps are being distributed by Licensee and that R3 has no responsibility for the contents or functionality of any of Licensee's CorDapps.  Licensee shall not make any representation or warranty regarding the Corda Enterprise Software in connection with the distribution of CorDapps, and shall not imply that R3 or any of its Affiliates has endorsed or made any representation or warranty regarding any CorDapp.

2.3	Operation of CorDapps.  (a)  Licensee agrees to use the Corda Enterprise Software and write CorDapps only for purposes that are permitted by (i) the Documentation, and (ii) all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United Kingdom or other relevant countries).  To the extent any of Licensee's CorDapps transmit data from the Corda Enterprise Software outside of the Corda Enterprise Software itself, Licensee shall notify all users that such transmission will take place and that R3 is not responsible for the privacy, security or integrity of any data transmitted via such CorDapp.  Licensee agrees that it will not create or distribute any CorDapp (i) for use in connection with any unlawful or illegal activity, or which would commit or facilitate the commission of a crime, or other tortious, unlawful, or illegal act, (ii) that is in any way offensive, profane, obscene or libelous, or (iii) that is designed to or that can be utilized for purposes of spamming users.

(b) 	Licensee shall not engage in any activity with the Corda Enterprise Software, including the development or distribution of CorDapps, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party, including but not limited to R3 and its Affiliates. Licensee is not permitted to develop or distribute any CorDapp that does or could potentially undermine the security of the Corda Enterprise Software or any other data or information stored or transmitted using the Corda Enterprise Software.

R3 shall have no responsibility to correct errors in Licensee's CorDapps or to notify Licensee of such errors.  In addition, Licensee shall be solely responsible for providing all support to users in connection with their use of Licensee's CorDapps, including any interface or connectivity between any CorDapp and the Corda Enterprise Software.

(d)	Licensee hereby represents and warrants that none of Licensee's CorDapps does or will contain any: (i) virus, Trojan horse, worm, backdoor, shutdown mechanism, malicious code, sniffer, bot, drop dead mechanism, or spyware; or (ii) any other software, code, or program that is likely to or is intended to: (1) have an adverse impact on the performance of, (2) disable, corrupt, or cause damage to, or (3) cause or facilitate unauthorized access to or deny authorized access to, or cause to be used for any unauthorized or inappropriate purposes, any software, hardware, network, services, systems, or data ("Malware"). If Licensee becomes aware of the existence of any Malware in or relating to any CorDapp of Licensee, Licensee shall promptly notify R3.

(e)  	Licensee's CorDapps shall not substantially replicate the Corda Enterprise Software, including any of its functionalities.   Licensee shall not disclose the results of any Corda Enterprise Software's benchmark tests to any third party without R3's prior written consent.
