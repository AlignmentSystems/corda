Welcome to Corda Enterprise 3.0!

This is a distribution package containing a bundled JVM. This is the only supported build of Corda Enterprise, so
please do not attempt to change the included JVM for a different one - JVM updates will be shipped as part of the
regular Enterprise update cycle.

Documentation: https://docs.corda.r3.com

To start a node, please rename the example-node.conf file and edit its contents so that it contains appropriate data for
your organization. Learn more here: https://docs.corda.r3.com/corda-configuration-file.html

Don't:

* Lose your private keys.
* Set devMode = true in production (devMode is ON by default and must be disabled in the config file).
* Use H2 as your database in production.
* Forget to set up database backups or replication.
* Place your database physically far from the node.

Your CorDapps should be placed in the cordapps directory, from which they will be loaded automatically.

JDBC drivers can be placed in the drivers directory.

To start the node, run ./bin/corda
